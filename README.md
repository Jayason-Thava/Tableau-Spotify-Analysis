# 🎵 Spotify Data Analysis (Tableau Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a practice exercise in **Tableau** using the **Spotify Features dataset** (`Extension_Task_SpotifyFeatures.csv`).  
The goal was to conduct an exploratory analysis to identify **trends and key information** that could be useful for organizations in future projects, such as understanding music preferences, track popularity, and audio features.

Dataset was imported into Tableau using the **Text File** option under the Connect Pane.
